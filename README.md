# README

Welcome to the documentation for setting up and running a Python project with `venv` and `mkdocs`. This guide will walk you through the steps to get your development environment ready, activate your virtual environment, and handle common issues you might encounter.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use a package manager like Homebrew on macOS.
- **Homebrew** (macOS only): If you are on macOS, Homebrew simplifies the installation of software packages.

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment helps manage dependencies for your project separately from the global Python environment. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a directory named `venv` containing a self-contained Python environment.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   To use the virtual environment, you need to activate it. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment.

### 2. Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the necessary dependencies for your project. Typically, you'll have a `requirements.txt` file listing the required packages. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running MkDocs

**MkDocs** is a static site generator that's geared towards project documentation. To build and serve your documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Install MkDocs**:
   If MkDocs is not listed in your `requirements.txt`, you can install it directly:

   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs
   ```

2. **Build the Documentation**:
   To build your documentation, use the following command:

   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

   If you encounter any errors related to library paths when running the build command, itâ€™s usually due to missing libraries. This is often seen on macOS where the dynamic linker needs to be directed to the appropriate library locations.

   **Fixing Library Path Errors**:
   If you get errors related to library paths, set the `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by running:

   ```bash
   export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

   Copy and paste this command into your terminal before running `mkdocs build` again.

3. **Serve the Documentation**:
   To preview your documentation locally, use:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   This command will start a local development server and you can view your documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Library Path Errors**:
  If you encounter errors related to missing libraries on macOS, ensure that the `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` is set correctly as described above.

- **Permission Issues**:
  If you face permission issues, make sure you have the necessary permissions to write to the directories where youâ€™re working.

- **Dependencies**:
  Double-check your `requirements.txt` to ensure all dependencies are listed. If a specific package is missing or causing issues, install it manually with `pip`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy your MkDocs app to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you are on the primary working branch** (usually `master` or `main`) of your git repository where you maintain the source documentation.

2. **Run the following command** to deploy your site:

   ```bash
   mkdocs gh-deploy
   ```

## Conclusion

By following these instructions, you should be able to set up your Python environment, run `venv`, and work with `mkdocs` effectively. If you have any further questions or run into issues not covered in this guide, consult the relevant documentation or community forums for additional support.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
