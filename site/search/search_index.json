A period not more than 96 hours consecutive, not to exceed 15 days per year. 2. No environmental stress with optimum operation and maintenance (GB35). Airflow Direction \u00b6 Passive cooling cards do not include a built-in fan and therefore require an external mechanism to ensure proper airflow for cooling. Passive cooling cards should be powered withs a forced airflow mechanism in place. The passively cooled RBLN-CA12 card supports bidirectional airflow as illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 2. Airflow Direction Notes: Conditions other than bidirectional flow are also possible. However, this is specific to server configurations, and testing is performed by individual OEMs. Contact your server provider for more information and options. Operating Conditions \u00b6 Details of operating conditions be updated in the official v1.0 document. Temperature Gradient \u00b6 The RBLN-CA12 accelerator card and its thermal management device should be able to operate at a temperature/time gradient of 15\u00b0C/hour in its ambient surroundings. The thermal management device is the heat sink, shroud, backplate, top plate, and fan (for active solutions). Humidity \u00b6 The RBLN-CA12 accelerator card and its thermal management device should be able to operate in a RH (relative humidity) range of 8% to 90%. Storage and Non-Operating Conditions \u00b6 The RBLN-CA12 accelerator card and its thermal management device should be stored or maintained in non-operating conditions in a RH range of 5% to 95% without condensation and an ambient temperature range of \u201340\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C. 3.

RBLN-CA12 PCIe Card Dimensions Board Diagram \u00b6 Figure 4 shows the components of the RBLN-CA12 card with the ATOM\u2122 chip. The card has a Satellite Management Controller (SMC) that performs board management operations while communicating to the host or BMC units via SMBus interfaces. (ISOVIEW) Figure 4. RBLN-CA12 Board Diagram PCI Connector/Data Rate \u00b6 The RBLN-CA12 card uses an ATOM\u2122 chip with a PCIe Gen5 x16 interface. The card supports PCIe 5.0 with 32 GT/s. The PCIe only can be configured to 16 lanes interfaces for either Gen5 specification or the lower specifications without supporting bifurcation. Satellite Management Controller (SMC) \u00b6 A CEC1736 resides on the RBLN-CA12 to control and monitor voltages, current and temperatures. The host server Board Management Controller (BMC) can interact with the SMC to monitor and control the card through out-of-band communication. RBLN SDK supports the PLDM protocol over MCTP SMBus, complying with DMTF standards. Using RBLN SDK, customers can conveniently monitor for any abnormal operation conditions and react proactively.","title":"English"},{"location":"en-rbln-ca12/#1-overview","text":"The Rebellions RBLN-CA12 accelerator card is a full height, full-length (FHFL), single-slot 10.5-inch PCI Express Gen5 equipped with ATOM\u2122, Rebellions\u2019 System-on-Chip (SoC) designed for deep learning inference.
