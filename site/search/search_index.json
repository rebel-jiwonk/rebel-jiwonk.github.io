Overview The Rebellions RBLN-CA12 accelerator card is a full height, full-length (FHFL), single-slot 10.5-inch PCI Express Gen5 equipped with ATOM\u2122, Rebellions\u2019 System-on-Chip (SoC) designed for deep learning inference. The card is passively cooled. RBLN-CA12 supports AI inference tasks for various neural network models, including Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Transformers. The card mainly targets inference acceleration on edge-computing platforms as well as High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads. It can be deployed in cloud data center for scalable AI applications.","title":"English"},{"location":"en-rbln-ca12/#1-overview","text":"The Rebellions RBLN-CA12 accelerator card is a full height, full-length (FHFL), single-slot 10.5-inch PCI Express Gen5 equipped with ATOM\u2122, Rebellions\u2019 System-on-Chip (SoC) designed for deep learning inference.
